# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to my simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python!
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a console-based implementation of the classic game. It involves two players who take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game continues until one player wins by forming a line of three consecutive symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the entire grid is filled, resulting in a draw.
